# diabetes-Prediction-ML---DT
This **Diabetes Prediction** project is designed to analyze medical data and predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients using machine learning models. The dataset consists of various health indicators such as glucose levels, blood pressure, insulin levels, BMI, and age, with an outcome label indicating whether a patient has diabetes or not. The project follows a structured workflow, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation.  

The repository includes essential files such as `diabetes.ipynb`, which contains the complete implementation in a Jupyter Notebook, `diabetes.csv`, which holds the dataset, and `requirements.txt`, which lists all necessary dependencies for running the project. To set up, users can clone the repository, install the required libraries, and execute the notebook for training and testing the model.  

The machine learning models used in this project are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the ROC-AUC curve to ensure reliable predictions. Contributions to improve the model or enhance the analysis are welcome, and the project is open-source under the MIT license.
